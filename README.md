### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I love opera, especially [Rigoletto](https://youtu.be/8A3zetSuYRg) and The Phantom of The Opera. But first, let's [take down the CCP](https://youtu.be/p-baX2JDfGI). This channel is dedicated to all those suffering from the suppression of the brutal CCP regime ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³, a trend that is exacerbated by Uyghur's concentration camps in XinJiang and brutal police crackdowns in Hong Kong. In this darkest moment, let us stand in solidarity with the Uyghurs, HongKongers, Tibetans, Mongolians, and Taiwanese, for them the sky is darkest before the dawn.
