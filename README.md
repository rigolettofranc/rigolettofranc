### Hi there 👋

I love opera, especially [Rigoletto](https://youtu.be/8A3zetSuYRg) and The Phantom of The Opera. But first, let's [take down the CCP](https://youtu.be/p-baX2JDfGI). This channel is dedicated to all those suffering from the suppression of the brutal CCP regime, a trend that is exacerbated by Uyghur's concentration camps in XinJiang and recent brutal crackdown by HK police. Let us stand in solidarity with the Uyghurs, HongKongers, Tibetans, Mongolians, and Taiwanese, for them the sky is darkest before the dawn.
